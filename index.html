The music pulsed low through the dim living room, amber lights painting soft shadows on the walls. Sophia sat curled into the corner of the couch, legs crossed, wine glass in hand. Her gaze flicked between the two across the room — Gauge, effortlessly cool, leaning against the doorframe, and Justin, sprawled across the armchair like he owned the place.

None of them said much, but the energy was thick. Tangible.

Gauge caught her glance and smirked. “You’re awfully quiet, Sophia.”

She tilted her head slightly, lips curling. “Just enjoying the view.”

Justin let out a low laugh. “You mean me or him?”

“Both,” she said, without hesitation.

That earned a glance between the two men — a silent exchange that said more than words ever could. Gauge finally moved from the wall, walking over to the couch with slow, confident steps. He sat beside her, close enough that his leg brushed against hers, just barely.

Sophia didn’t move away.

Justin stayed still at first, watching them like a storm building. Then he rose, slow and deliberate, circling around the back of the couch. His fingers brushed the side of her neck — a featherlight touch that made her eyes flutter shut for just a second.

The tension crackled.

“You know,” Gauge murmured near her ear, “we’ve both noticed the way you look at us.”

Sophia turned slightly, heartbeat climbing. “And what if I’ve noticed the way you look at me?”

Justin leaned down, voice smooth. “Then maybe it’s time we stop dancing around it.”

Gauge’s hand slipped to the small of her back. Justin’s breath was warm against her neck. The air between them tightened, thick with heat, and for a moment — just a breathless moment — no one moved.

Three hearts, one spark.

And the night had only just begun.

🌒 "Late Heat" – Part 2: The Shift
Sophia leaned into the tension, lips parted, but something shifted.

Not in her — in Justin.

His gaze had moved, not to her, but across her — locked with Gauge’s. Not a glance, not curiosity. Something deeper. Something unspoken finally bubbling to the surface.

Gauge felt it too. That slow realization. The look that lingered just a little too long.

Sophia blinked, sensing the change. “What?” she asked with a teasing smirk.

Neither of them answered right away.

Then Justin let out a quiet breath, almost a laugh, as if finally giving in to something he’d been holding back.

“You know,” he murmured, stepping a little closer to Gauge, “I think I’ve been looking at you just as much as her.”

Gauge's eyes didn’t flinch. “Thought I imagined that.”

Justin’s voice lowered. “You didn’t.”

Sophia didn’t seem surprised — more intrigued, backing off the tension as if she knew she’d just sparked something else.

The space between the two guys closed fast. Not rushed. Not confused. Just undeniable.

And when Justin leaned in — Gauge met him halfway.

It wasn’t dramatic. Just real. Honest. The kind of kiss that settles into place like it was always meant to happen.

Sophia raised her glass with a grin, watching with an approving spark in her eyes. “Well,” she whispered to herself, “this night got even better than I expected.”

🌒 "Late Heat" – Part 3: No More Lines
The kiss between Gauge and Justin slowed, but the heat didn’t leave the room — it just changed direction.

Sophia watched, one brow arched, her smile soft but wicked. She stood up slowly, setting her glass down on the coffee table with a light clink.

“Alright,” she said, stepping toward them, her tone playful and precise. “That was hot… but don’t think I’m letting you two have all the fun.”

She reached for the hem of her top, teasing it upward — deliberate, slow, not for shock but for control. Justin blinked, breath caught. Gauge didn’t look away.

She wasn’t just reclaiming the spotlight — she was rewriting it.

As the top slipped over her head and fell to the floor, silence dropped over the room like gravity. The tension wasn’t confused — it was magnetic. Balanced. Gauge’s eyes flicked from Justin to Sophia. Justin stepped back slightly, just enough to take her in fully, but didn’t break the charge between them.

Gauge whispered, “So... what are we now?”

Sophia stepped closer, hands brushing both their shoulders as she pulled them in.

“Not straight. Not gay. Not confused,” she said, lips close, voice velvet.
“Just... ourselves.”

The lines had blurred. The rules rewritten. And the three of them—Gauge, Justin, and Sophia—stood at the edge of something new. Not chaos. Not fantasy. Something real and raw and theirs.

A throuple with no need for explanation—only understanding.

🌒 "Late Heat" – Part 4: The Shift Beneath the Surface
The room was dim and warm, bodies close, breath heavier than before. Gauge sat back against the couch cushions, his shirt long forgotten. Justin leaned near, one hand still resting on Gauge’s thigh, fingers lingering with a familiar boldness.

Sophia stood over them — lips parted, chest rising and falling — but something had changed.

Not in her confidence. Not in the way she looked at them.

But in the way their eyes had started to see her.

Gauge’s gaze dropped, and for the first time, it wasn’t just want — it was curiosity. Realization. Justin saw it too. The moment her jeans hugged her hips tighter as she stepped closer. The soft outline beneath her waistband, undeniable but unspoken — until now.

The room slowed.

Gauge blinked. Justin shifted slightly. And Sophia… paused.

She was no longer teasing. Her hands fell to her sides. “You see it,” she said, voice soft, almost guarded.

Gauge sat up straighter. “Yeah,” he said gently. “We do.”

Justin's brow creased — not in discomfort, but in adjustment, as if gears in his brain were clicking into place.

Sophia looked between them, the playful glow in her eyes dimming to something more vulnerable. “This is where it usually breaks,” she said, barely above a whisper. “Where the flirting stops. Where they say they’re not into that. Where I get told I should’ve said something sooner.”

There was silence.

Then Gauge stood, slow and deliberate. He stepped in close, reached out — not to grab, not to grope, but to brush a strand of hair behind her ear.

“Sophia,” he said softly, “you don’t owe us an apology for being you.”

Justin followed, stepping beside her, placing a hand lightly over her wrist. “You’re not a surprise,” he added. “You’re a whole damn revelation.”

Her eyes watered, just barely, but she smiled — like someone finally being seen without needing to explain why they deserved it.

And just like that, the tension returned — heavier, more magnetic. Not just desire, but truth. A spark that burned hotter because it was built on something real.

She leaned forward, pressing her forehead to Gauge’s shoulder. Justin’s hand stayed over hers.

They weren’t a fantasy anymore. They were messy, tangled, real. And that was so much better.

🌘 "Late Heat" – Part 5: Fire and Fractures
It had been weeks since that night.

The three of them had become something between a secret and a sanctuary. Days blurred. Nights deepened. The connection between Gauge, Sophia, and Justin became less about boundaries and more about trust.

But trust is fragile.

And sometimes, heat hides fault lines.

Sophia stood by the window that night, rain tapping the glass. Her hands trembled slightly, not from fear — but from the weight of a conversation she never wanted to start.

“I know what you did,” she said without turning around.

Behind her, Justin sat on the edge of the bed, eyes shadowed.

Gauge stood between them, the silence suffocating.

Justin’s jaw tightened. “It wasn’t like that.”

Sophia turned. “You met with your ex behind my back, Justin. Lied. Then came home like nothing happened.”

Gauge stepped forward. “Is that true?”

Justin’s silence was answer enough.

The tension cracked, and Sophia shook her head. “We trusted you. Both of us.”

Later that night, as Sophia stormed out into the rain, Gauge stayed behind. Anger burned under his skin, but so did something else. A longing, not for clarity — but for understanding.

He turned to Justin, emotions colliding.

“You lied to her,” Gauge said, voice low. “You broke something we built.”

Justin looked up. “And you’re still here.”

The air between them shifted again, not with lust — but with raw emotion. Pain, regret, and a connection neither had words for.

“I don’t hate you,” Gauge admitted. “But I don’t know how to forgive you either.”

Justin stepped closer, eyes rimmed with guilt. “Then don’t forgive me. Just feel something. Anything.”

Gauge’s voice cracked. “I already do.”

In that moment, anger turned to something else — grief, longing, and an unresolved ache that pulled them together in a reckless, silent embrace. Not to fix what was broken — but to acknowledge that it was.

Outside, Sophia stood in the rain, not gone — just waiting.

Waiting to see if they would fall apart…
or finally face the truth of what they had become.

🌹 "Late Heat" – Part 6: The Return of the Chaos
It was three days later when Sophia returned.

She didn’t knock.

She kicked the door open with enough force to knock a candle off the table, lightning flashing behind her like she was a gay storm goddess sent by the drama gods themselves.

Gauge dropped his cereal bowl in shock. “Sophia—?!”

Justin, who was wearing Gauge’s hoodie and nothing else, spat out his protein shake like a sitcom side character.

Sophia stood there dripping rainwater, makeup flawless, a full dramatic trench coat on — for no reason, really — and said the line of a lifetime:

“Miss me, sluts?”

The tension in the room skyrocketed. Gauge blinked. Justin blinked harder.

Sophia took three slow steps inside, unbuttoning the trench coat like she was about to reveal a secret identity. Underneath?

A silk top, leather pants, and the confidence of a Bond villain in stilettos.

“You two thought you could fall apart without me and keep the spice? Please.”

Justin tried to speak. “I—”

Sophia raised a finger. “Shhh. Shirtless people don’t get to talk right now.”

Gauge nearly passed out from the hot-and-confused energy swirling in the room.

💥 Then, the Chaos Escalated:
Gauge backed up into the kitchen. Sophia followed.
Justin followed her.
Gauge tried to grab a water bottle but knocked over three forks and accidentally turned on the blender.

The blender screamed. So did they.

“Turn off the blender, Gauge!”
“I DIDN’T EVEN MEAN TO TURN IT ON, SOPHIA!”

Eventually, they all ended up in the living room — tangled on the couch, emotionally exhausted, half-laughing, half-breathless. The tension wasn't just romantic now — it was cosmic.

Sophia looked at them both. “So… we doing this or what?”

Gauge raised an eyebrow. “You mean the emotional healing?”

Justin smirked. “Or the passionate make-out session with feelings?”

Sophia grinned. “Yes.”

🎭 Fade Out:
They didn’t fix everything that night.

But they did end up cuddling, laughing, sharing snacks shirtless, and accidentally ordering $87 worth of sushi they didn’t remember tapping “Confirm” on.

And somehow, in the chaos, the tears, and the tangled limbs…

They felt whole again.

🌴 "Late Heat" – Part 7: We’re Not Ready for the Resort
Somehow, someone (probably Justin) had the brilliant idea:

“We should take a couples trip.”

Sophia blinked. “We’re not a couple. We’re a throuple.”

Gauge raised a hand. “Also, we barely survived living in the same ZIP code.”

But it was too late. Flights were booked. A resort was chosen. And just like that, they were at the airport with three matching duffle bags and zero emotional preparation.

✈️ Day One: The Flight Was a Warning
Justin got "randomly searched" by TSA because he packed handcuffs and claimed they were "for yoga."

Gauge brought zero chargers. Zero.
Sophia screamed at the check-in desk because they put "Mr." on her boarding pass. The gate agent apologized in three languages and upgraded her seat.

The trio landed in Cancun deeply sweaty and already emotionally unstable.

🏝️ Day Two: Enter Chaz
He arrived like a cursed prophecy — sunburnt, shirtless, wearing seashell necklaces and speaking exclusively in riddles.

Chaz, the yoga instructor hired by the resort, introduced himself by saying:

“I once loved a cactus and it loved me back… painfully.”

Justin: “Why is he so confusing yet kind of hot?”

Gauge: “He’s like a puzzle I want to solve but also throw into the ocean.”

Sophia: “I will marry him if either of you steps out of line again.”

🍹 Day Three: The Emotional Meltdown (and a Piña Colada Fight)
During beach yoga (led by Chaz, of course), Gauge fell over during downward dog, knocking Justin into a pineapple cart.

Sophia spilled her piña colada on a stranger.

The stranger fought back.

And the fight was mostly over fruity drinks and bad dance moves but lasted a solid 45 minutes.

💬 Day Four: Confessions by the Fire
That night, the three of them sat by a bonfire — bruised, sticky, but honest.

Gauge confessed his fear of commitment.
Justin admitted to still missing his ex.
Sophia wondered if they could ever really be a family.

Chaz showed up out of nowhere and started playing a steel drum, turning the awkward silence into something almost magical.

✨ Day Five: The New Beginning
They didn’t solve everything.

They didn’t even figure out half the questions.

But under the stars, holding hands, and laughing through the chaos — they realized they didn’t have to have all the answers.

Because they had each other.

And sometimes, that was enough.
